### Hi Everyone 👋

My name is Mahika Pandit and I am currently a high school student in the Bay Area, California! I was introduced to coding in 2nd grade when I first used Scratch, since then I've learned many different coding languages including: Thunkable, Swift, Python, and my personal favorite Java. Through GitHub, I want to share my learnings with others in hopes they too can learn and understand coding in a simple manner.
